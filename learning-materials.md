## How to begin with the field of NLP, Machine Learning and Deep Learning 

In my opinion, best way to start with the area of the machine learning, deep learning and NLP is by watching online courses. There is quite a lot of them online, but I recommend:
- For NLP (and Deep Learning): Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing course from Stanford (http://cs224d.stanford.edu/)
